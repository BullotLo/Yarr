'rd53a_test.bdaq.json' is a copy of the sample file 'rd53a_test.json', 
generated by default when no other configuration is found, with some
modifications. These modifications configure the right number of 
output lanes, clocks, etc for BDAQ operation with firmware v0.11.0.

Just copy 'rd53a_test.bdaq.json' to 'rd53a_test.json' to properly
setup the BDAQ operation.
